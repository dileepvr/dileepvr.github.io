The <a href="https://www.oregoncountryfair.org/">Oregon Country Fair</a> sees regular participation by students and
faculty from the Physics department at the University of Oregon. We
typically camp at an &ldquo;ask a scientist&rdquo; booth inside the &ldquo;energy park&rdquo; and
set up from demos allowing us to initiate conversations on
solar/wind/turbine/energy concepts. The <a href="https://pages.uoregon.edu/stanm/Demo/demo.html">Physics Dept. Demo room</a> had some
nifty coils of wire that they&rsquo;d use to generate <code>e.m.f.</code> by moving a
magnet in and out (or side-to-side) in proximity. They were using
galvanometers to demonstrate both magnitude and sign of the induced
voltage, but it wasn&rsquo;t flashy enough. So I thought I&rsquo;d throw together a
bad-LED setup.

<p>
The basic design would use a resistor-ladder divider to generate
voltage-step references, and then use comparators to trigger LEDs. The
Texas Instruments <code>LM3914</code> driver chip does precisely that. Reference
everything to some midpoint between the terminals of the power supply,
and we get &ldquo;negative&rdquo; detection too!

The <a href="ohwd.html#ID-d3c6249a-293f-4a74-8504-3a02536e54e0">Weather balloon team</a> at the <a href="https://eugenemakerspace.com/">Eugene Maker Space</a> tasked me with coming
up with a sensor board that would sit outside of the temperature
insulated payload chassis. After some amount of brainstorming, we decided
to put a weather chip, a tiny solar panel, and some kind of spectrometer.
I decided to construct a poor man&rsquo;s low resolution spectrometer by mixing
together photodiodes with different responsivity peaks. So I went with
Adafruit&rsquo;s breakout boards for the <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/products/439"><code>TSL2561</code></a> (reports luminosity,
broadband and IR values), the <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/products/1918"><code>GUVA-S12SD</code></a> UV sensor, and the <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/products/2748"><code>ALS-PT19</code></a>
natural light sensor chip. Adafruit happens to carry a breakout board for
the <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/products/2652"><code>BME280</code></a> temperature, pressure, and humidity sensor chip as well. The
idea is to solder all of them on a single PCB.
</p>

<p>
All of them are meant to talk to an ATMEGA32u4 microcontroller either
through <code>I2C</code> bus, or an analog <code>IN</code> pin (we measured the open-circuit
voltage of the solar panel). The microcontroller then periodically (4
times a second) comminucates with a computer inside the payload via a USB
connection. The <a href="https://github.com/dileepvr/sensorbrd/tree/master/firmware">firmware</a> relies heavily on the <a href="https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_Sensor/archive/master.zip">Adafruit-Sensor</a> Arduino
libraries. After some calibration, we&rsquo;d have to think of ways to make it
always face the sun!

The <a href="https://scilit.uoregon.edu/">Science Literacy Program</a> at the University of Oregon often funds
graduate students to help develop and teach new courses. In 2013, my then
advisor <a href="https://oco.uoregon.edu/faculty/michael-raymer">Prof. Mike Raymer</a> happened to be creating one called &ldquo;Quantum
Mechanics for Everyone&rdquo;, and asked <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/christopher-jackson-82984ba8">Chris Jackson</a> and me to help design
and TA the course. Naturally, I accepted. At the time, I was just getting
into microcontrollers, and was looking for a project that could use
<code>ATTINY2313</code> chips. I had to teach Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) to the
class, and hence, had to develop an in-class, hands-on activity that
would help teach non-majors. This, the spin-half board was born.
</p>

<p>
The board has an RGB LED, an SPST switch to change &ldquo;bases,&rdquo; and three
push (tactile) buttons. Onboard surface mount LEDs (red and green)
indicate if the current state is the &ldquo;red/blue&rdquo; basis, or the
&ldquo;green/white&rdquo; basis. It fits in the palm of one&rsquo;s hand, and is powered
with a coin cell (on the back of the board). <a href="https://github.com/dileepvr/spin_half/blob/master/spin_half_doc.pdf">This document</a> explains how
it is meant to be used. It essentially allows a student to function as a
spin-half particle, able to respond to external measurements by other
students. They then learn to follow the algorithm illustrated in this
in-class <a href="https://github.com/dileepvr/spin_half/blob/master/qkd_handout.pdf">handout document</a> and learn to respect the Born rule. The
activity involved learning to transmit bits from one student to another,
and to study the effects of a third student functioning as an
eavesdropper. The board was programmed using the six ICSP header pins
using <a href="https://github.com/dileepvr/spin_half/tree/master/avr_code">code</a> written in <code>avr-gcc</code>. I used a <code>USBtinyISP</code> from <a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/">Sparkfun</a> to
upload the code using the avrdude interface utility.

I needed a simple demonstration for AM (amplitude Modulation) based
transmission and reception. The primary aim was to demonstrate
orthogonality of disjoint frequency bands. And I wanted to do this below
100 kHz, so that a regular oscilloscope could keep up and show some
waveforms. DO NOT DO THIS. I was swamped with thermal noise, and just
barely got it to work!

<p>
The transmitter was using analog multiplier chips. I considered making a
Gilbert cell by myself, but couldn&rsquo;t find matched transistor pairs. Other
lessons learnt: Arrange gain amplifiers at the receiver in descending
order such that the largest gain is nearer the antenna. This way, noise
at every stage doesn&rsquo;t get amplified at successive stages too much (work
this out mathematically. HW assignment!) Also, note that there are
low-noise signal (operational) amplifiers that do the voltage
translation, and there are power amplifiers, that can actually drive
large amounts of current necessary to vibrate a speaker. Use one of those
at the end.

I&rsquo;ve attempted to use infrared (IR) emitter-detector pairs in many a
project. But unless they are being used as photogates (closely spaced and
directly facing each other like IR interrupters), they have always been
susceptible to noise. Things got particularly crazy on the <a href="repo.html#ID-a5719355-2a56-4990-b5e7-50b62ac11b80">SPICE camp
Pinball</a> tables, which would rack up points in the presence of
incandescent bulbs in the ceiling. The solution is obvious: upshift the
information to a higher frequency where there is lesser environmental
noise (which is mostly DC). Then use lockin detection, or bandpass
filters followed by a demodulation circuit. Sounds complicated, until you
realize that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_IR">commercial remote control technology</a> has been doing this for
decades.

<p>
The IR receivers come at various IR wavelengths and carrier frequencies.
They are astoundingly sensitive, and can pick my signal out from large
distances even in sunlight, as long as there is line of sight. People
normally advocate using a microcontroller to do both modulation (at the
transmission end), and demodulation (at the receiver end), but I&rsquo;d
recommend offloading mundane tasks to dedicated, dump circuits and
keeping the microcontroller scheduler free for important tasks.
