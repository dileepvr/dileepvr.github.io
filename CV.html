<strong class="header">Masters Thesis:</strong><br>
2-D analysis of the difference in alternating current distributions between low-permeability and high-permeability conductors with irregular cross-sections.<br>
Date of Submission: May 16th, 2009<br>
Advisor: Prof. Harishankar Ramachandran<br>
Workplace: Department of Electrical Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology, Madras<br><br>

<strong class="header">Pre-Graduate Research Experience:</strong><br>

<LI>Exploration of Free Energy Barriers to structural relaxation using Forward Flux Sampling, and Umbrella Sampling Techniques.<br>
Status: Paper in preparation<br>
Date: Summer, 2008<br>
Guide: Prof. Srikanth Sastry<br>
Venue: Jawaharlal Nehru Center for Advanced Scientific Research (JNCASR), Bangalore<br>
  The Project entailed Monte Carlo simulation of the glass-forming liquid at various temperatures, and the use of Forward Flux Sampling and Umbrella Sampling to explore free energy barriers to structural relaxation.<br><br>


<LI>Design and Construction of a Capacitive Discharge based Table-top Electromagnetic Mass-Accelerator.<br>
Date: Summer, 2007<br>
Guide: Prof. K. P. J. Reddy<br>
Venue: Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bangalore<br>
   The Project entailed use of Finite-Element Methods to numerically simulate discharge characteristics, current distributions and force dynamics of the device, as well as design and physical construction of synchronous high-power transistor switches to be used to trigger rapid discharge of capacitor banks.<br><br>

<LI>Estimation of Free Energy Barrier for Crystal Nucleation in a Supercooled liquid drop via Monte Carlo Simulations and Umbrella Sampling Technique.<br>
Date: Summer, 2006<br>
Guide: Prof. Srikanth Sastry<br>
Venue: Jawaharlal Nehru Center for Advanced Scientific Research (JNCASR), Bangalore<br>
   The Project entailed Monte Carlo Simulations of crystallization of a metastable liquid of particles interacting via the Lennard-Jones potential. An orientational order parameter based on spherical harmonics  was used to define the order parameter quantifying the degree of  of crystallization. This reaction coordinate was  used in Umbrella Sampling to determine the free-energy barrier to crystallization. Radial location of the critical nucleus was recorded.<br><br>

<LI>Experimental Determination of Energy and Sugar conservation efficiency in Fermentation of Sugarcane Extract into Ethanol.<br>
Date: Summer, 2003<br>
Guide: Dr. H. N. Chanakya<br>
Venue: Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bangalore<br>
   The Project entailed yeast-aided fermentation of pure Sugarcane extract into dilute Ethanol, followed by estimation of conservation ratio of saccharides (sugars) at different stages of the fermenting period using Nelson-Somogyi method of sugar concentration determination.
<br><br>
<LI>Experimental Study of Stomatal Structure and Activity with respect to Time of day for Various Flora.<br>
Date: Summer, 2000<br>
Guide: Dr. H. N. Chanakya<br>
Venue: Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bangalore<br>
   The Project entailed use of a semi-solid gel of polystyrene dissolved in Xylene solvent to create transparent moulds of stomata and other
   micrometer structures on lower leaf surfaces, and their observation under optical microscope. Surface number density and active/closed
   state of Stomata were identified. These parameters were recorded for various species of Flora at different times of the day.<br><br>
