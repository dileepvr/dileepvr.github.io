All first courses on electromagnetism introduce Coulomb&rsquo;s expression for
the electric field due to a point charge. Given an electron with charge
\(-q\), the field at a distance \(r\) away would read \[\mathbf{E} =
	 \frac{-q}{4\pi\epsilon_0r^2}\hat{\mathbf{e}}_{\mathbf{r}}.\]
</p>

<p>
Thus, if another electron were to be placed at said location at a
distance \(r\) from the first one, it would experience the existence of
the first electron as a repulsive force, albeit diminished in magnitude
due to distance.
</p>

<p>
What if one were to move the first electron? How soon would the second
electron detect this change? And in what manner?
</p>

<p>
It is possible (though not necessarily useful) to reduce all of
Maxwell&rsquo;s equations into a form well suited for discussing point charges
such as these. To quote from Richard P. Feynman&rsquo;s &ldquo;Lectures on Physics
Vol. I,&rdquo; chapter 28, the full form looks like \[\mathbf{E}=
   \frac{-q}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\left[\frac{\hat{\mathbf e}_{\mathbf
   r'}}{r'^2} + \frac{r'}{c}\frac{d}{dt}\left(\frac{\hat{\mathbf
   e}_{\mathbf r'}}{r'^2}\right)+\frac{1}{c^2}\frac{d^2}{dt^2}\hat{\mathbf
   e}_{\mathbf r'}\right].\]
</p>

<p>
The little prime on \(r\) is meant to account for the time-delay for
information to travel from the electron to the measurement point. \(r'\)
is the retarded distance, and \(\hat{\mathbf e}_{\mathbf r'}\) the
apparent direction pointing towards where the source electron was
located at a time \(r'/c\) ago.
</p>

<p>
The first two terms are merely the Coulombic field, and a first-order
temporal correction to it. The both of them scale as \(1/r^2\), and can be
neglected at large distances. The third term, however, depends on the
transverse/lateral acceleration (i.e. perpendicular to the
line-of-sight) of the source electron, and falls off with distance, at a
rate slower than the Coulombic terms: \[E_\perp =
	 \frac{-q}{4\pi\epsilon_0c^2r}a_\perp\left(t-\frac{r}{c}\right).\]
</p>

<p>
This indicates that the electromagnetic field has a sluggish quality to
it that causes rapid disturbances to spread out in space at speed \(c\).
It also implies that accelerating charges radiate energy. We see this in
synchrotron radiation, and use it in free-space communication
technologies. The slow, \(1/r\) fall-off is also the reason light emitted
by electronic motion in a galaxy 5 billion light-years away can be
picked up by CCD detectors here on earth.

In practice, it is rather difficult to isolate a single electron, and
then cause it to accelerate, and subsequently detect its radiation.
However, note that the radiative component of the electric field is
separate from the Coulombic components, which can be cancelled by an
inertial positive charge placed at the right location. Meaning, we can
generate radiation by inducing a bulk acceleration of several free
(conductive) electrons in a neutral wire of metal, as is done in
typical transmission antennae.

<p>
Applying a simple, monochrome Sine-wave voltage across a straight metal
rod would generate an oscillating dipole field in its vicinity. The
efficiency with which said dipole antenna would radiate energy away
depends on the length of the rod relative to the wavelength of light at
that Sine-wave frequency (a la impedence-matching), but the basics of
our field formula would still hold. If the dipole were aligned along
the z-axis in polar coordinates, then the field amplitude would fall
off as \(1/r\), irrespective of the azimuthal angle \(\phi\). But because
the field depends on the transverse acceleration of the charges
perpendicular to the line of sight, the polar (\(\theta\)) dependence
would be a simple Cosine-projection, and would vanish directly above or
below the rod.

<p>
The field structure becomes more interesting when we place two dipole
antennae in parallel (at locations \(S_1\) and \(S_2\) in the above
figure), and drive them in sync with the same Sine-wave voltage.
Naturally, the both of them would produce their own independent,
oscillating-dipole electric fields. The total field would be the
vector-sum of the two. And because the fields are sinusoidal, receivers
at different locations (\(D_1\), \(D_2\), \(D_3\)) would experience the two
fields retarded by different amounts, based on the relative distances.
Consequently, the two waves would add constructively in some
directions, and destructively in others.

<p>
The number of hotspot (and cancellation deadzone) sectors around the
two antennae is determined by the distance between them, relative to
the wavelength of the frequency in question. In the above image, for
example, the dipoles are being driven in-phase (i.e. together), and are
placed two wavelengths apart. The resulting field distribution is
essentially the Young&rsquo;s double-slit interference pattern. We can swap
the hotspots with the deadzones by merely shifting one of the dioples
in phase by \(180^\circ\) relative to the other, as shown below.

<p>
To illustrate the addition of monochrome Sine-waves better, I have
created these one-dimensional, unidirectional, toy animations of dipole
radiators and receivers. For further simplicity, the \(1/r\) decay of the
amplitude has also been neglected. If two sources (red and blue) were
placed two wavelengths apart and driven in-phase (in sync), then the
receiver (green) would indeed see a coherent sum of the two individual
waves.
</p>

<p>
If the sources were to be driven out of phase, then naturally, in the
collinear direction, the waves would cancel each other.
</p>

<figure id="org6051347">
<img src="img/r_NWM_ant06.gif" alt="r_NWM_ant06.gif" width="780">

</figure>

<p>
Another way to destructively interfere in the collinear direction while
still being driven in-phase is to separate the sources by a distance
that is an integer number of wavelengths plus half-a-wavelength, as
below.
</p>

<p>
Of course, the next obvious step is to add more antennae. Still sticking
to the simple, one-dimensional picture, one can cause a regularly spaced
array of dipole antennae to constructively interfere in the collinear
direction, if their relative phases are connect for their relative
positions. For instance, antennae separated by a whole number of
wavelengths have to oscillate in phase, and those separated by a whole
number plus half-a-wavelength have to oscillate out of phase, as shown
below. The principle carries over to arbitrary separations as well.
</p>

<p>
If we return to the two-dimensional, in-plane radiation pattern, we will
observe a more complex fringe structure than mere two-slit interference.
For example, if we had six radiators (like below), then there would be
fewer directions in which all six dipole patterns would add
constructively. Consequently, all the output power would be concentrated
into narrow sectors along special directions determined by the exact
seperation and relative phases. The more antennae we add, the more knobs
we have to play with (positions of said antennae, power, phase, and
orientation of each, etc.), the better our control over the radiation
pattern. This is the basic concept behind <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phased_array">phased arrays</a>.
</p>

<p>
The radiation pattern of an antennae array is identical to it&rsquo;s
sensitivity plot. In other words, if a giant array of antennae were all
to receive a single-frequency (monotone) signal, then the relative
phases of the signals from each subcomponent of the array can reveal the
exact direction of it&rsquo;s origin (up to the resolution of the array, which
depends on the size of the array, etc.). This is how large arrays of
radio telescopes pinpoint the sources of cosmic signals without having
to move much. Perhaps the best use case of antennae arrays is in radars,
where they are used to both transmit and receive. And the most famous
example for one of these is the fabled <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duga_radar">Russian Woodpecker</a>.

So much for large antennae. We now move on to tiny atoms. Ever since
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraunhofer_lines">Fraunhofer (and Wollaston before him)</a> discovered dark depressions in
the solar spectrum in the early 19th century, we&rsquo;ve known about special
absorption frequencies for various materials. Over two centuries worth
of work has lead to a pretty solid theory to explain these as
electronic transitions between energy levels. However, we are concerned
with how atoms behave when excited at frequencies far away from any of
its absorption lines. That is, what happens when an electromagnetic
wave of frequency that is not resonant with any electronic transition
within an atom, excites it? A good model for the atom&rsquo;s behavior turns
out to be a simple, classical particles on a spring!
</p>

<p>
The heavy nucleus is unlikely to respond much to a weak, external wave.
The electrons, however, get easily knocked around. If the external,
non-resonant field isn&rsquo;t too strong, the electrons in a free, gaseous
atom will simple oscillate about the nucleus at a matching frequency,
and along the direction of the polarization of the external field. The
atom know behaves like a miniature dipole antenna. The oscillating
electron will know lose its energy (due to acceleration) back into the
electromagnetic field by radiating in a dipole pattern. This occurs in
systems where the atoms/molecules are smaller than the wavelength of
the external field, and is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rayleigh_scattering">Rayleigh scattering</a>. This is why one
can see the path of a laser beam in the fog. And to a large extent,
this is also why the sky is blue.
</p>

<figure id="orgd9de306">
<img src="img/r_NWM_trans02.png" alt="r_NWM_trans02.png" width="780">

</figure>

<p>
The direction of the re-radiated power from individual atoms has no
correlation to that of the external beam (apart from the polarization
orientation of the dipole). If we were to consider a whole host of
atoms, then the picture changes. For instance, we return to the
one-dimensional picture, and place a linear array of atoms as a
stand-in for the bulk of a transparent medium. Since we don&rsquo;t need to
restrict ourselves to crystalline media, we can space them randomly as
well. But as long as the dipoles are all being driven by the same
coherent, external beam, then they will automatically be phased to
re-radiate constructively in the &ldquo;forward&rdquo; direction of the external
beam. With more atoms in the path (i.e. thicker the slab), the less the
power scattered in other directions. Therefore, a beam can pass through
a slab of glass, or a glass of water, largely unmolested. The energy of
the beam has to temporarily be shared between the electromagnetic
field, and the eletrons in the medium, however. This leads to some
interesting effects that are the subject of the following sections.
