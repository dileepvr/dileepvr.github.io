<a href="https://git-scm.com/">Git</a> is a free and open source, version-control software. <a href="https://github.com">Github</a> is a
private company that has thrown its servers open to the public to store
their git repositories online for free (subject to size constraints).
This frees people from the hassle of setting up their own online
repositories, and aids in small-scale collaborative coding. My own github
page can be found at <a href="https://github.com/dileepvr">https://github.com/dileepvr</a>. While most of them have
licenses and README files, some of them have interesting stories behind
them.

<a href="https://oco.uoregon.edu/">Oregon Center for Optical, Molecular, &amp; Quantum Science</a>, under the
direction of its assistant Director <a href="https://oco.uoregon.edu/contact-us">Dr. Brandy Todd</a>, has been hosting
<a href="https://spicescience.uoregon.edu/spice/join">SPICE CAMP</a> at the University of Oregon for several summers now. It is
typically billed as a two-week long, science and engineering camp for
middle-school girls, although the definition undergoes subtle changes
every iteration. The camp itself is split into three tracks: Discovery
(for 6th graders), Forensics (for 7th graders), and Engineering (for 8th
graders). Participants are expected to attend all three tracks over three
summers.

I got involved with SPICE when a friend with a shared interest in
beam-robotics convinced me to volunteer for it. I was tasked with leading
some Engineering camp sessions, and designing/debugging/assembling
electronics for it. One year, we decided to add microcontroller
programming to the curriculum, and I was asked to design and teach a few
pilot sessions on it. Based on the feedback, we decided to make Arduino
programming a core component of the camp. As it stands to day, the
engineering camp has the participant teams learning to program an
Atmega32u4 using the Arduino IDE, learning to use various sensors (piezo
elements, push-buttons, IR detectors) and actuators with it, and
ultimately integrating the whole into a fully functional pinball table.
And I&rsquo;ve been writing and maintaining some libraries in this <a href="https://github.com/dileepvr/spice-pinball">git
repository</a> to make the coding easier to implement and parse.
</p>

<p>
The lessons/sessions have been neatly formatted into a <a href="https://agoering.github.io/spice-pinball/">hypertext
tutorial-style website</a> by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/andreagoering">Andrea Goering</a>. <a href="https://pages.uoregon.edu/wwe/">Wes Erickson</a> and Cody Jarrett
have also been fellow contributors. Some of the functionality (like the
motor H-bridge) requires custom PCBs to function. The library itself is
very transparent and convenient. I find myself often using it in other
projects when I don&rsquo;t want to bother with internal timer and interrupt
registers for the avr chips that power the whole thing. This library has
been released under a modified version of the MIT license.

CARD COUNTING IS LEGAL.
</p>

<p>
The best (worst?) a casino can do if they suspect you of it is to bar you
from playing blackjack, and share your face and name with all associated
casinos using a distributed blacklist maintained by one of many dedicated
private companies. This repository contains code meant to simulate
blackjack games under various house rules and counting strategies. So
far, I&rsquo;ve only implemented dealer-vs-single-player, but this could easily
be extended to multiple players at the same table, each at various
positions using their own strategies. This is able to reproduce results
from other independent sources pretty well, so I&rsquo;ve trusted it enough to
base decisions on it during my own <a href="http://rightshift.blog/home/Card-Counting">adventures</a>.

The code is written in C, and I&rsquo;ve released it under the MIT license. The
file main.cu exists in the repo because at one point, I considered using
this project to teach myself some cuda-GPU programming. I have since
found other avenues for that goal.

Ever since I played my first videogame, I&rsquo;ve wanted to make one from
scratch. This dream is yet to be fully satisfied (watch this space).
Tadpole was an early attempt at a casual, 2D, sprite-based arcade
experience. In more recent times, I&rsquo;ve been very interested in socket
programming, and network protocols. I decided to turn the software into a
casual, live multiplayer, party game. The idea is to have the game server
persistently running on a projector at a gathering. The game can spawn
players at any time for every instance of a TCP socket being opened and
the right information exchanged (ideally, this should be done over local
wifi). The objective is to stay alive as long as possible, and climb the
hi-score board.

<a href="https://pages.uoregon.edu/wwe/">Wes Erickson</a> is working on a <a href="https://github.com/inflamedspirit/Tadpole_Controller">Javascript controller</a>, which would allow one
to name and spawn a player, and control it via the browser by visiting a
url. So this could be played on cellphones. I intend to make some
hardware controllers on breadboards for this as well (watch this space).
The rest of the code has been sucessfully field tested.

I had a lot of fun coding the AI for this. The frogs show pack behavior.
They are aware of each other&rsquo;s movements and will try to flank you, guard
the fly, and so on. The background waves are all sequences of sprites
with an alpha-channel transparency layer. The sound effects are from
creative commons licensed files floating about on the web. Someday, I
hope to port it to render with <code>openGL</code> or <code>openGL_ES</code>, so as to exploit
hardware acceleration.

If you&rsquo;ve followed my blog posts on <a href="http://rightshift.blog">Rightshift</a>, you&rsquo;ll know of Project
Novena-X. I am building a laptop around the <a href="https://www.kosagi.com/w/index.php?title=Novena_Main_Page">Novena Motherboard</a>. I have
gone a bit crazy with the project, and am trying to interface with a
rediculously proprietary, backlit, Dell keyboard (<code>0wx4jf</code>), and also
deck the front display panel out with a character LCD module, an E-ink
display, as well as internal <code>i2c</code> devices and an <code>nRF24l01+</code> module.

<p>
The circuitry meant to interface between all of these diverse elements is
relying on USB hubs and a bunch of avr microcontrollers (the schematics
can be found in the repo). I have laid them out on 2-layer PCBs using the
open-source <a href="http://kicad-pcb.org/">kicad</a> suite, which Ihappen to use for all my PCB (printed
circuit board) projects.
</p>

<p>
The layout has undergone some iterations. I am currently testing the
various subsystems to see if they work independently.

I am using <a href="https://oshpark.com/">OSHPark</a> as a PCB printing service. They print 2-layer boards
at $5 per square inch (with 3 copies of the board included in that
price). They also print 4-layer boards at a different prince. Just upload
the zip file inside the gerber folder of the project <a href="https://github.com/dileepvr/novenaX_kicad">repository</a> unto
their website and you are good to go.
