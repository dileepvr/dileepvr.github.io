"For once you have tasted flight you will walk the Earth with your
eyes turned skywards, for there you have been and there you will long
to return."  - <strong class="header">Leonardo Da Vinci</strong><br>

"Those who can make you believe absurdities can also make you commit
atrocities." - <strong class="header">Voltaire</strong><br>

"The louder he talked of his honor, the faster we counted our spoons."

"You can wax, exfoliate, and paint yourself into a statue of a
goddess, we don't care. Because there's a girl standing over there, on
the bridge, staring at the horizon like she's a thousand miles away,
singing a dark, and beautiful song for its own sake. And now you will
never win. Because you will never have that. You will never DO, that."
- <strong class="header">Doctor Randomercam</strong><br>

"To ravage, to slaughter; to usurp under false titles, they call
empire; and where they make a desert, they call it peace." - <strong class="header">Publius
Tacitus</strong><br>
           	<p>&nbsp;</p>
"There is an all-out confrontation between the ironic and the literal
mind: between every kind of commissar and inquisitor and bureaucrat
and those who know that, whatever the role of social and political
forces, idea and books have to be formulated and written by
individuals." - <strong class="header">Christopher Hitchens</strong><br>
           	<p>&nbsp;</p>
"If the government becomes a lawbreaker, it breeds contempt for law;
it invites every man to become a law unto himself; it invites
anarchy. To declare that in the administration of the criminal law the
end justifies the means—to declare that the government may commit
crimes in order to secure the conviction of a private criminal—would
bring terrible retribution. Against that pernicious doctrine this
court should resolutely set its face." - <strong class="header">Louis D. Brandeis</strong><br>
