<strong class="header">G. K. Chesterton</strong><br>
		  <p>&nbsp;</p> "Apparently it is wrong, when finding
carol singers at your door, to yell 'Hail Satan! See you in

           	<p>&nbsp;</p>

           	<p>&nbsp;</p>
" Against stupidity, the very gods themselves content
  in vain." - <strong class="header">Friedrich Schiller</strong><br>

Tacitus</strong><br>
           	<p>&nbsp;</p>
"There is an all-out confrontation between the ironic and the literal
mind: between every kind of commissar and inquisitor and bureaucrat
and those who know that, whatever the role of social and political
forces, ideas and books have to be formulated and written by
individuals." - <strong class="header">Christopher Hitchens</strong><br>
           	<p>&nbsp;</p>
"If the government becomes a lawbreaker, it breeds contempt for law;
it invites every man to become a law unto himself; it invites
anarchy. To declare that in the administration of the criminal law the
end justifies the means—to declare that the government may commit
crimes in order to secure the conviction of a private criminal—would
bring terrible retribution. Against that pernicious doctrine this
court should resolutely set its face." - <strong class="header">Louis D. Brandeis</strong><br>
		  <p>&nbsp;</p>
“If men learn this, it will implant forgetfulness in their souls; they
will cease to exercise memory because they rely on that which is
written, calling things to remembrance no longer from within
themselves, but by means of external marks. What you have discovered
is a recipe not for memory, but for reminder. And it is no true wisdom
that you offer your disciples, but only its semblance, for by telling
them of many things without teaching them you will make them seem to
know much, while for the most part they know nothing, and as men
filled, not with wisdom, but with the conceit of wisdom, they will be
a burden to their fellows.”
- <strong class="header">Plato, on the written word</strong><br>
           	    <p>&nbsp;</p>
"A human being should be able to change a diaper, plan an invasion, butcher a hog, con a ship, design a building, write a sonnet, balance accounts, build a wall, set a bone, comfort the dying, take orders, give orders, cooperate, act alone, solve equations, analyse a new problem, pitch manure, program a computer, cook a tasty meal, fight efficiently, die gallantly. Specialisation is for insects." - <strong class="header">Robert A. Heinlein</strong><br>
           	    <p>&nbsp;</p>		    
"You can wax, exfoliate, and paint yourself into a statue of a
goddess, we don't care. Because there's a girl standing over there, on
the bridge, staring at the horizon like she's a thousand miles away,
singing a dark, and beautiful song for its own sake. And now you will
never win. Because you will never have that. You will never DO, that."
- <strong class="header">Doctor Randomercam</strong><br>
           	      <p>&nbsp;</p>
"All courses of action are risky, so prudence is not in avoiding danger (it's impossible), but calculating risk and acting decisively. Make mistakes of ambition and not mistakes of sloth. Develop the strength to do bold things, not the strength to suffer." - <strong class="header">Niccolò Machiavelli</strong><br>		      
           		<p>&nbsp;</p>
			"... a public can achieve enlightenment only slowly. A revolution may bring about the end of a personal despotism or of avaricious tyrannical oppression, but never a true reform of modes of thought. New prejudices will serve, in place of the old, as guidelines for the unthinking multitude." - <strong class="header">Immanuel Kant</strong><br>
           		  <p>&nbsp;</p>
			  "Soon we will search
in the margins of your history, in distant countries,
for what was once our history. And in the end we will ask ourselves:
Was Andalusia here or there? On the land ... or in the poem?" - <strong class="header">Mahmoud Darwish</strong><br>
           		<p>&nbsp;</p>			  			  			  "Feel, feel, I say -- feel for all you're worth, and even if it half kills you, for that is the only way to live, especially to live at this terrible pressure, and the only way to honour and celebrate these admirable beings who are our pride and our inspiration." - <strong class="header">Henry James</strong><br>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>			  			  			  "The man who is endowed with important personal qualities will be only too ready to see clearly in what respects his own nation falls short, since their failings will be constantly before his eyes. But every miserable fool who has nothing at all of which he can be proud adopts, as a last resource, pride in the nation to which he belongs; he is ready and glad to defend all its faults and follies tooth and nail, thus reimbursing himself for his own inferiority." - <strong class="header">Arthur Schopenhauer</strong><br>
           		<p>&nbsp;</p>			  				  "Every joke is a tiny revolution." - <strong class="header">George Orwell</strong><br>
           		  <p>&nbsp;</p> "Satire and comedy both make
			  use of the comic contradiction, but their
			  aims are different. Satire would arouse in
			  readers the desire to act so that
			  contradictions disappear; comedy would
			  persuade them to accept the contradictions
			  in good humor as facts against which it is
			  useless to rebel."
