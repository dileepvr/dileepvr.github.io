<li>&ldquo;The mediator between head and hands must be the heart.&rdquo; <b>- Thea von
Harbou, Epigram from &ldquo;Metropolis&rdquo; (silent film)</b></li>

<li>&ldquo;The mass of men lead lives of quite desperation.&rdquo; <b>- Henry David
Thoreau</b></li>

<li>&ldquo;Tradition means giving votes to the most obscure of all classes, our
ancestors. It is the democracy of the dead. Tradition refuses to submit
to the small and arrogant oligarchy of those who merely happen to be
walking about.&rdquo; <b>- G. K. Chesterton</b></li>

<li>&ldquo;Apparently it is wrong, when finding carol singers at your door, to
yell &lsquo;Hail Satan! See you in Disneyland!&rsquo; and slam it on them. But I
don&rsquo;t want to be right.&rdquo; <b>- Warren Ellis</b></li>

<li>&ldquo;Great are the Stars, and Man is of no account to them.&rdquo; <b>- Olaf Stapledon, from &ldquo;Last and First Men&rdquo; (novel)</b></li>

<li>&ldquo;Philosophy is a battle against the bewitchment of our intelligence by the means of language.&rdquo; <b>- Ludwig Wittgenstein</b></li>

<li>&ldquo;&#x2026;even these crimson hands thou sever&rsquo;st from my valiant arms shall
yield a thousand fold – for when the earth hath drunk my blood, an iron
harvest she shall yield, of hostile hands to enslave and bind thine
own.&rdquo; <b>- Galvarino (Spanish given name), Mapuche Indian Warrior</b></li>

<li>&ldquo;The Night, once the font of the Unknown, becomes only the lack of the
Sun.&rdquo; <b>- The Trickster&rsquo;s Lament, from &ldquo;Thief&rdquo; (videogame)</b></li>

<li>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a good thing I like human comedy, because there&rsquo;s been plenty of
it to appreciate.&rdquo; <b>- John Perry Barlow, Founder of EFF</b></li>

<li>&ldquo;Anything worth doing is worth doing slowly.&rdquo; <b>- Mae West</b></li>

<li>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tell me the moon is shining; show me the glint of light on
broken glass.&rdquo; <b>- Anton Chekhov</b></li>

the actions of states.&rdquo; <b>- Hans J. Morgenthau</b></li>

<li>&ldquo;I dare not belittle you. You will all become Buddhas.&rdquo; *- Passage from
the Lotus Sutra, chanted as a prayer for the benefit of all sentient

<b>- The Book of Changes</b></li>

<li>&ldquo;Against stupidity, the very gods themselves content in vain.&rdquo; <b>-
Friedrich Schiller</b></li>

turned skywards, for there you have been and there you will long to
return.&rdquo; <b>- Leonardo Da Vinci</b></li>

atrocities.&rdquo; <b>- Voltaire</b></li>

empire; and where they make a desert, they call it peace.&rdquo; <b>- Publius
Tacitus</b></li>

<li>&ldquo;There is an all-out confrontation between the ironic and the literal
mind: between every kind of commissar and inquisitor and bureaucrat and
those who know that, whatever the role of social and political forces,
ideas and books have to be formulated and written by individuals.&rdquo; <b>-
Christopher Hitchens</b></li>

<li>&ldquo;If the government becomes a lawbreaker, it breeds contempt for law; it
invites every man to become a law unto himself; it invites anarchy. To
declare that in the administration of the criminal law the end
justifies the means—to declare that the government may commit crimes in
order to secure the conviction of a private criminal—would bring
terrible retribution. Against that pernicious doctrine this court
should resolutely set its face.&rdquo; <b>- Louis D. Brandeis</b></li>

<li>“If men learn this, it will implant forgetfulness in their souls; they
will cease to exercise memory because they rely on that which is
written, calling things to remembrance no longer from within
themselves, but by means of external marks. What you have discovered is
a recipe not for memory, but for reminder. And it is no true wisdom
that you offer your disciples, but only its semblance, for by telling
them of many things without teaching them you will make them seem to
know much, while for the most part they know nothing, and as men
filled, not with wisdom, but with the conceit of wisdom, they will be a
burden to their fellows.” <b>- Plato, on the written word</b></li>

<li>&ldquo;A human being should be able to change a diaper, plan an invasion,
butcher a hog, con a ship, design a building, write a sonnet, balance
accounts, build a wall, set a bone, comfort the dying, take orders,
give orders, cooperate, act alone, solve equations, analyse a new
problem, pitch manure, program a computer, cook a tasty meal, fight
efficiently, die gallantly. Specialisation is for insects.&rdquo; <b>- Robert
A. Heinlein</b></li>

<li>&ldquo;You can wax, exfoliate, and paint yourself into a statue of a goddess,
we don&rsquo;t care. Because there&rsquo;s a girl standing over there, on the
bridge, staring at the horizon like she&rsquo;s a thousand miles away,
singing a dark, and beautiful song for its own sake. And now you will
never win. Because you will never have that. You will never DO, that.&rdquo;
<b>- Doctor Randomercam</b></li>

<li>&ldquo;All courses of action are risky, so prudence is not in avoiding danger
(it&rsquo;s impossible), but calculating risk and acting decisively. Make
mistakes of ambition and not mistakes of sloth. Develop the strength to
do bold things, not the strength to suffer.&rdquo; <b>- Niccolò Machiavelli</b></li>

<li>&ldquo;&#x2026; a public can achieve enlightenment only slowly. A revolution may
bring about the end of a personal despotism or of avaricious tyrannical
oppression, but never a true reform of modes of thought. New prejudices
will serve, in place of the old, as guidelines for the unthinking
multitude.&rdquo; <b>- Immanuel Kant</b></li>

<li>&ldquo;Soon we will search in the margins of your history, in distant
countries, for what was once our history. And in the end we will ask
ourselves: Was Andalusia here or there? On the land &#x2026; or in the
poem?&rdquo; <b>- Mahmoud Darwish</b></li>

<li>&ldquo;Feel, feel, I say &#x2013; feel for all you&rsquo;re worth, and even if it half
kills you, for that is the only way to live, especially to live at this
terrible pressure, and the only way to honour and celebrate these
admirable beings who are our pride and our inspiration.&rdquo; <b>- Henry
James</b></li>

<li>&ldquo;The man who is endowed with important personal qualities will be only
too ready to see clearly in what respects his own nation falls short,
since their failings will be constantly before his eyes. But every
miserable fool who has nothing at all of which he can be proud adopts,
as a last resource, pride in the nation to which he belongs; he is
ready and glad to defend all its faults and follies tooth and nail,
thus reimbursing himself for his own inferiority.&rdquo; <b>- Arthur
Schopenhauer</b></li>

<li>&ldquo;Every joke is a tiny revolution.&rdquo; <b>- George Orwell</b></li>

<li>&ldquo;Satire and comedy both make use of the comic contradiction, but their
aims are different. Satire would arouse in readers the desire to act so
that contradictions disappear; comedy would persuade them to accept the
contradictions in good humor as facts against which it is useless to
rebel.&rdquo; <b>- W. H. Auden</b></li>

<li>&ldquo;But thou wilt never find him who would be quite qualified to mock at
thee, the individual, at thy best, who could bring home to thy
conscience its limitless, buzzing and croaking wretchedness so as to be
in accord with truth. To laugh at oneself as one would have to laugh in
order to laugh out of the veriest truth.&rdquo; <b>- Friedrich Nietzsche</b></li>

<li>&ldquo;Great men are almost always bad men, &#x2026;&rdquo; <b>- Lord Acton</b></li>

<li>&ldquo;After us, the people of our race will wear garments of gold. They will
eat sweet, greasy food, ride splendid coursers, and hold in their arms,
the loveliest of women. And they will forget that they owe these
things, to us.&rdquo; <b>- Genghis Khan</b></li>

<li>&ldquo;The infliction of cruelty with a good conscience is a delight to
moralists&#x2013;that is why they invented hell.&rdquo; <b>- Bertrand Russell</b></li>

<li>&ldquo;In the fields of observation, chance favors only the prepared mind.&rdquo;
<b>- Louis Pasteur</b></li>
