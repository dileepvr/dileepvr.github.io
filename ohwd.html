		<h3>Transit of Mercury</h3>

		  <p>On the 9th of May 2016, the planet Mercury happened to slowly transit across the face of the Sun (from Earth's perspective). Prof. <a href="http://physics.uoregon.edu/profile/rsf/">Scott Fischer</a>, Dean Walton, Erik Keever and I decided to deploy two telescopes out in the open on campus. One of them employed interference-based bandpass filters at the Helium alpha line (667.8 nm). The other was a Newtonian type, 10" Dobsonian scope, and was used to project an image of the Sun onto a board. The Sun was bright enough for a clean image even in broad daylight.</p>

		  <p>The transit was already in progress as the Sun rose on the west coast. The entire transit took 8 hours to run through its course. We were out until about 12 PM local time. It managed to attract some public attention.</p>

		  <p>Unlike Venus, mercurial transits are relatively more common. They occur about 13 to 33 years apart. Despite the orbital period of Mercury being about 88 Earth-days, the planar tilt of its orbit is opposite that of the Earth. It's day-night cycle is tidally locked to it's orbital period to a ratio of 3/2. The planet's silhouette was about 1/160th the diameter of the Sun. A bit of an anti-climax, really, unless you know what you are looking at.</p>

		  <p>On the 5th of June 2012, the planet Venus happened to slowly transit across the face of the Sun (from Earth's perspective). Erik Keever and I decided to deploy a Cassegrain telescope out in the open on campus and project the Sun onto a whiteboard. The spectacle lasted all day, and attracted much public attention. The Sun was bright enough for a clean image even in broad daylight. The equatorial mount helped. A tracking motor would have helped even more.</p>

		  <p>The event is said to occur in pairs about 8 years apart, but the pairs are seperated by about 243 years. So the next one will occur on the 10th of December in the year 2117. Can't wait!</p>
