In July of 2016, I bumped into the <a href="https://eugenemakerspace.com/">Eugene Maker Space</a> at the local faire
through a friend (Dean Walton) on campus. They (Rick Osgood, Weston
Turner) were showcasing a payload that they intended to send up above the
stratosphere tethered to a weather balloon. They had my attention.
</p>


<figure id="org55ede15">

<p>
The payload consisted of a raspberry pi, a handheld programmable radio, a
TNC inbetween the two, a camera, and a GPS module. While most such
payloads include a cellphone, the FCC frowns on that practice. This might
have something to do with catching too many cell towers at once. This one
however was programmed to transmit it&rsquo;s coordinates via standard APRS
radio packets. I offered my BME280 weather chip breakout board to the
setup so we could monitor temperature, pressure, and humidity as well.
The chassis was designed and put together by Jeffrey Graman.
</p>

<p>
Kevin Forsyth also designed a second payload with several raspberry pis&rsquo;
and cameras as a panoramic photoshoot device. There exist prediction
applets that chart expected balloon paths after taking payload weights,
balloon size, amount of Helium, and date/time/location of launch as
inputs. We launched ours from central Oregon a few hours later than
scheduled. The path didn&rsquo;t drift significantly. We had to give chase in
our cars (and eventually on foot) for nearly four hours, all the while
receiving live packets from the payload and displaying the coordinates on
a map in our laptops (and radioing information to the rest of the
convoy). It turns out that others in neighboring towns (including Eugene)
had also received strange APRS packets with ridiculous altitude values.
</p>

<p>
The balloon popped above 80,000 feet. The chassis was well insulated,
rendering the temperature and pressure data only contextually
interesting. The best part of the trip was to actually catch visual sight
of the balloon at its highest point (the balloon expands in size as it
rises into thinner air), and watch it burst (suddenly disappear). We lost
radio contact with it for a while during the parachuted descent, but
recovered it as we got closer to its expected drop point. Finding it
dangling off of a tree branch was pretty cool too. The EMS will be
planning another launch with an expanded team, a better chassis, and a
more sophisticated payload (with external sensors). We&rsquo;re waiting for the
weather to get better.

On the 9<sup>th</sup> of May 2016, the planet Mercury happened to slowly transit
across the face of the Sun (from Earth&rsquo;s perspective). Prof. <a href="https://physics.uoregon.edu/profile/rsf/">Scott
Fischer</a>, <a href="https://about.me/DeyWalt">Dean Walton</a>, Erik Keever and I decided to deploy two telescopes
out in the open on campus. One of them employed interference-based
bandpass filters at the Helium alpha line (667.8 nm). The other was a
Newtonian type, 10&ldquo; Dobsonian scope, and was used to project an image of
the Sun onto a board. The Sun was bright enough for a clean image even in
broad daylight.
</p>

<p>
The transit was already in progress as the Sun rose on the west coast.
The entire transit took 8 hours to run through its course. We were out
until about 12 PM local time. It managed to attract some public
attention.

<p>
Unlike Venus, mercurial transits are relatively more common. They occur
about 13 to 33 years apart. Despite the orbital period of Mercury being
about 88 Earth-days, the planar tilt of its orbit is opposite that of the
Earth. Its day-night cycle is tidally locked to its orbital period to a
ratio of 3/2. The planet&rsquo;s silhouette was about 1/160th the diameter of
the Sun. A bit of an anti-climax, really, unless you know what you are
looking at.

I do some volunteer work for <a href="https://spicescience.uoregon.edu/">SPICE Camp</a> every summer, as is mentioned
<a href="repo.html">elsewhere</a>. And one of the most loved exercises is the one where we get
the kids to take old, surplused computer towers apart for parts. Most of
them have never seen the guts before, and they are natural destroyers of
things. Back in 2013, during a routine brainstorming session on possible
new activities for the camp, we (<a href="https://pages.uoregon.edu/wwe/">Wes</a> and I) attempted to create a
project where parts from CD-drives and hard disks (the voice coil or
readhead) could be put together to make 2D plotters and scanners. We
ended up scrapping the idea on account of the design being to unreliable
and time consuming. But we did successfully create some prototypes.

<p>
Linear stages are a pain to deal with. Having dabbled in trying to make a
reprap, I am intimately familiar with that pain. The drive trays are
controlled by DC motors. Some read heads are controlled by DC motors, and
others by stepper motors. To work with DC motors and get an estimate of
distance travelled, we used photogates (IR interrupters) and black
patterns printed onto transparencies.

<p>
We had end-stops for edge-limit detection, and a startup, full travel
routine to estimate maximum range for both directions. All the &ldquo;images&rdquo;
were ascii files with a dot for blank space, an &ldquo;x&rdquo; for marked pixel, and
an &ldquo;n&rdquo; for new line. The scanner simply used a photodiode to measure
reflection from a laser pointer. The plotter however, used a hard-drive
voice coil to lift and drop the pen. This was a huge mistake, as it was
heavy, and tended to jerk the whole light device out of alignment. The
drop and lift angles weren&rsquo;t vertical either, and voice coils are a huge
power draw. All of these were controlled by custom-etched motor driver
boards based on the H-bridge <code>LM293D</code> chip.
</p>

<p>
The whole assembly is held together by electrical tape and epoxy.
Scanners would have communicated ASCII over serial to plotters. We would
have had half the teams build plotters and the other half, scanners. We
had even worked out how to power the whole thing using ATX power supplies
(also pulled out of the computer towers). But the project became too
complicated for the scope of the camp. They could be reworked into
standalone camps though. Hit me up if you need the code.

On the 5<sup>th</sup> of June 2012, the planet Venus happened to slowly transit
across the face of the Sun (from Earth&rsquo;s perspective). Erik Keever and I
decided to deploy a Cassegrain telescope out in the open on campus and
project the Sun onto a whiteboard. The spectacle lasted all day, and
attracted much public attention. The Sun was bright enough for a clean
image even in broad daylight. The equatorial mount helped. A tracking
motor would have helped even more.

<p>
The event is said to occur in pairs about 8 years apart, but the pairs
are seperated by about 243 years. So the next one will occur on the 10<sup>th</sup>
of December in the year 2117. Can&rsquo;t wait!
