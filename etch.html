		  <p>I made this as part of a logo design contest
		    for the <a href="http://oco.uoregon.edu/">Oregon Center for Optical, Molecular & Quantum Science (OMQ)</a>, which was formerly known as the Oregon Center for Optics (OCO).
		    I tried spelling the letters O, M, and Q using shapes of temporal and spatial modes. A cutsie interference fringe pattern broke the O into a Q. The winning
		  logo is basically a resubmission of the <a href="http://oco.uoregon.edu/omq-logo">old OCO logo</a>, which is an excellent design.</p>

		  <p> This was made as part of a Department T-shirt
		  design contest here at the University of Oregon. The
		  original image is from the Solvay Physics conference
		  held in 1927. I photographed my own hands making the
		  Ducks O sign with various variations & shears, and
		  superimposed them on each of the scientists. Masking
		  the transition was a bit hard. I had to erase some
		  legitimate hands and fix Max Planck's hat with some
		  plastic surgery. Posterising via GIMP to reduce the
		  number of colors to 3 and tracing the bitmap via
		  Inkscape made the image T-shirt print ready.</p>

<p> On a whim, a couple of fellow grad students and I got ourselves
enrolled into a fine metal works class at
the <a href="http://craftcenter.uoregon.edu"> Craft Center</a> here at
the UofO (under Margerita O'Brien Sensei). I planned to make a tiny
dragonfly out of sterling silver, and decided to make a copper draft
first to get used to the process. Almost the whole dragonfly started
out has a single copper sheet. The wings were cut using a tiny dill
bit and a fret saw. The upper and lower bodies were beaten into copper
sheets using chasing and repousse techniques (including bulges and
ridges). The legs were just copper wire with the ends heated in a
blow-torch flame until surface tension caused the molten end to ball
up. Silver-solder the whole thing together, then tumble, then work
harden. Presto. The silver one will have a blue Sapphire mounted on
  its back, and a silver chain coming off of the wings.</p>

		  <p> This was for my undergrad hostel (dorm?) T-shirt
		  from 2008. The hostel is named Saraswathi (all
		  hostels were named after rivers). Saraswathi is also
		  the Hindu goddess of knowledge and intellectual
		  pursuits. She is often depicted holding a Veena,
		  which is an Indian string instrument with dual
		  resonance chambers. The goddess logo was designed by
		  Mickey (we all had nicknames at IITM).</p>
