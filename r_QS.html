		Consider the statement, "Human eyes can see single photons." This has been the subject of research [<a href="http://jgp.rupress.org/content/25/6/819">1</a>,<a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/physics/Quantum/see_a_photon.html">2</a>,<a href="http://www.nature.com/news/people-can-sense-single-photons-1.20282">3</a>] ever since the term "photon" became common place in our scientific lexicon. There is a lot to unpack in that one claim. One possible approach could be to adopt a skeptical cynic's viewpoint, and demand definitions. For starters, let's just assume that "photon" is merely fancy jargon for "a weak amount of light that people can allegedly see with their eyes," and exploit this provisional, functional definition to construct an experiment.

		This wonderful image (above) was a 2014 submission by Vicente Torres-Zuniga (Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico) made to a photo contest held by the <a href="http://www.osa-opn.org/home/gallery/photo_contests/2014/14-09-29_(37)/">Optics and Photonics</a> magazine. It demonstrates a wonderful phenomenon that I encourage the reader to independently verify, that shining a green laser pointer into extra-virgin olive oil will generate red light. If we were to decrease the intensity of the green laser by throwing some smoked glass in its path, this would predictably decrease the amount of red light generated. One could then package the whole assembly in a box with two collinear pinholes (covered with some red filters), and label the contraption a "Photon source."
		<img src="images/r_QS_photon_source.png" width=800>
		  Of course, we would have to choose/tweak the opacity of the smoked-glass plate until the amount of red light escaping the box is feeble enough to allow us to use the term "photon" without getting funny looks. We can calibrate this by relying on a trusty graduate student, who has been forced to stay in a pitch-dark room for half-an-hour, and then has been instructed to let out an audible scream if they happen to see any mild flashes of light.
		<img src="images/r_QS_gradapd.png" width=800>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		The typical scream pulse lasts for about a second. And the grad-student will need to inhale for about half-a-second before the next scream, which gives us an effective detector dead-time of about 1.5 seconds. To be safe, we can adjust the intensity of the source until we don't hear two consecutive screams occurring sooner than a hundred dead-times apart (150 seconds) at a frequency higher than, say, once a day. The student could, in principle, be trained to change the pitch of his/her scream based on the color of the flash, thus approximating a low-resolution, human spectrometer. This proposal is still being reviewed by the University ethics committee.
