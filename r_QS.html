Consider the statement, &ldquo;Human eyes can see single photons.&rdquo; This has
been the subject of research [<a href="http://jgp.rupress.org/content/25/6/819">1</a>, <a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/physics/Quantum/see_a_photon.html">2</a>, <a href="http://www.nature.com/news/people-can-sense-single-photons-1.20282">3</a>] ever since the term &ldquo;photon&rdquo;
became common place in our scientific lexicon. There is a lot to unpack
in that one claim. One possible approach could be to adopt a skeptical
cynic&rsquo;s viewpoint, and demand definitions. For starters, let&rsquo;s just
assume that &ldquo;photon&rdquo; is merely fancy jargon for &ldquo;a weak amount of light
that people can allegedly see with their eyes,&rdquo; and exploit this
provisional, functional definition to construct an experiment.
</p>

This wonderful image (above) was a 2014 submission by Vicente
Torres-Zuniga (Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico) made to a photo
contest held by the <a href="http://www.osa-opn.org/home/gallery/photo_contests/2014/14-09-29_(37)/">Optics and Photonics</a> magazine. It demonstrates a
wonderful phenomenon that I encourage the reader to independently
verify, that shining a green laser pointer into extra-virgin olive oil
will generate red light. If we were to decrease the intensity of the
green laser by throwing some smoked glass in its path, this would
predictably decrease the amount of red light generated. One could then
package the whole assembly in a box with two collinear pinholes
(covered with some red filters), and label the contraption a &ldquo;Photon
source.&rdquo;
</p>

<figure id="org36e7adb">
<img src="img/r_QS_photon_source.png" alt="r_QS_photon_source.png" width="780">

</figure>

<p>
Of course, we would have to choose/tweak the opacity of the
smoked-glass plate until the amount of red light escaping the box is
feeble enough to allow us to use the term &ldquo;photon&rdquo; without getting
funny looks. We can calibrate this by relying on a trusty graduate
student, who has been forced to stay in a pitch-dark room for
half-an-hour, and then has been instructed to let out an audible scream
if they happen to see any mild flashes of light.
</p>

<figure id="orgec4de6f">

<p>
The typical scream pulse lasts for about a second. And the grad-student
will need to inhale for about half-a-second before the next scream,
which gives us an effective detector dead-time of about 1.5 seconds. To
be safe, we can adjust the intensity of the source until we don&rsquo;t hear
two consecutive screams occurring sooner than a hundred dead-times
apart (150 seconds) at a frequency higher than, say, once a day. The
student could, in principle, be trained to change the pitch of his/her
scream based on the color of the flash, thus approximating a
low-resolution, human spectrometer. This proposal is still being
reviewed by the University ethics committee.

<p>
Any glass window that looks transparent when faced head-on, partially
reflects light incident on it at a slanting angle. It is possible to
manufacture glass that can reflect half the light incident on it, and
transmit the other half through. In the lab, we call such optical
elements &ldquo;beamsplitters.&rdquo; We can easily verify their purported property
by employing two detectors, like in the setup below.
</p>

<figure id="org05d130b">
<img src="img/r_QS_beamsplitter.png" alt="r_QS_beamsplitter.png" width="780">

</figure>

<p>
If we were to record the total number of times both Alice and Bob happen
to scream in the above experiment, over the course of, say, an entire
day, then for a perfect 50/50 beamsplitter, one would find that both
their totals would be nearly equal (up to minor random fluctuations that
are much smaller than the totals themselves). However, there is another
quantity that could be recorded. Namely, the number of times the both of
them happen to scream together (i.e. simultaneously, up to average
duration of a scream). It turns out that this &ldquo;coincidence count&rdquo;
actually depends on their relative distances from the beamsplitter.
</p>

<p>
We can perform a scanning measurement, by fixing Bob&rsquo;s position, and
starting Alice off at a location very close to the beamsplitter. If we
were to measure the number of simultaneous screams per day, over several
days, while asking Alice to step away from the beamsplitter a tiny bit
at the beginning of each day, then we&rsquo;d encounter a very strange result.
</p>

<figure id="org79b11bd">
<img src="img/r_QS_g2.gif" alt="r_QS_g2.gif" width="780">

</figure>

<p>
It turns out that the number decreases as their distances from the
beamsplitter start to match each other. In fact, if Alice and Bob were
to stand at exactly equal distances from the beamsplitter, then they
would never scream simultaneously, no matter how many days pass. This
seems to hint at the possibility of photons possessing some indivisible,
particle-like nature. It is as if the beamsplitter is unable to split
the photon into two halves, but instead sorts it into one path or the
other with equal chance. This experiment opens the doorway for a
definition of a &ldquo;photon&rdquo; that is somewhat more independent of the
properties of it&rsquo;s detectors.
</p>

<p>
<b>Aside:</b> Interestingly, this effect would completely disappear if we
were to use a weak laser beam in place of the fancy, olive-oil based
photon source. The laser data would simply flatline. The reason for this
is beyond the scope of this article.

<p>
But, it gets weirder. Now, we will use two 50/50 beamsplitters and a
couple of regular mirrors (those that reflect all the light incident on
them) to construct the setup below. Here, the photons, upon encountering
the first beamsplitter, would presumably travel via one of the paths
labeled &rsquo;1&rsquo; or &rsquo;2,&rsquo; at the ends of which, it would run into the second
beamsplitter, which would sort it into either of the output ports
labeled &rsquo;A&rsquo; or &rsquo;B.&rsquo;

<p>
This is commonly known as a Mach-Zehnder interferometer. Such setups
were commonly used to demonstrate the so called, wave nature of light.
If the light going in were set to be of a single color (wavelength)
only, then the difference in lengths of path 1 and path 2 could be
adjusted so that all the light would exit along only one of the ports,
and not the other. The choice of exit ports can be tuned by adjusting
the path-length difference. Here is a demonstration of that effect.
</p>

<iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vLTIM0d70vY?start=436&end=782&version=3" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p>
If we were to arrange our interferometer such that all the light would
exit at, say, port B, then we would only hear Bob&rsquo;s screams from the
lab. Alice would stay silent, no matter how long one were to wait. So it
would appear, that both the photons that took path 1, and the ones that
took path 2, knew to turn towards Bob at the second beamsplitter. This,
however, raises a conundrum. What would happen if one were to block path
1 with a brick wall?
</p>

<figure id="org787c01c">
<img src="img/r_QS_MZ.gif" alt="r_QS_MZ.gif" width="780">

</figure>

<p>
It is easy to work out that half the photons would simply hit the wall
and be lost to us. The second half would traverse path 2, and split
towards either output ports with half chance. This would mean that both
Bob, and Alice, would scream with equal likelihood (and never together).
But consider this: How did the photons that made Alice scream know about
the brick wall when they didn&rsquo;t run into it? Wouldn&rsquo;t they have turned
towards Bob had the wall been absent?!
